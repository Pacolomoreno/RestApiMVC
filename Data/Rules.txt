Blackjack Rules – The Basics
Blackjack (also called 21) is a popular casino card game where players compete against the dealer, not each other. The goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand without going over (busting).

1. Card Values
(Ace) = 1 or 11     (2-10) = value      (J, Q, K) = 10 
2. How to Play
Players place bets.
Bank deals 2 cards to the player sum values and decide  must hit or stand in closest value to 21 without busting over.
Bank reveals his hand value and hands are compared—whoever is closer to 21 without busting wins and get reward while other lose it.

3. Player Options
Hit → Take another card.
Stand → Keep your current hand.
Double Down → Double your bet & take one more card.
Split → If you have two of the same card, split them into two hands (must match original bet).
Surrender (if allowed) → Give up half your bet and fold.

4. Dealer Rules
The dealer must hit if their hand is 16 or lower.
The dealer must stand if their hand is 17 or higher (even a "soft 17" if the casino allows it).

5. Winning & Payouts
Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) → Pays 3:2 (e.g., $10 bet wins $15).
Regular win → Pays 1:1 (e.g., $10 bet wins $10).
Push (tie) → Bet is returned.
Dealer busts → All remaining players win.

6. Special Rules
Insurance (if dealer’s upcard is Ace) → Side bet (pays 2:1) if dealer has blackjack.
Even Money (if you have blackjack & dealer shows Ace) → Take 1:1 payout instead of risking a push.
